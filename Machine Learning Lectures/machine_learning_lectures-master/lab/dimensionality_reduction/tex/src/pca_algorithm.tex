\begin{frame}{PCA: algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Arrange your data in a $n\times d$ matrix $X$, where $n$ is the number of samples and $d$ is data dimensionality
\item Compute the mean $\mu$ ($d$-dimensional vector) of all samples
\item Compute convariance matrix
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma = (X-\mu)^T(X-\mu)
\end{equation*}
\item Pick the first $m$ eigenvectors of $\Sigma$ (ordered by decreasing eigenvalues), where $m$ is the dimensionality you want your data to be projected to
\item Arrange such eigenvectors in a $d\times m$ matrix $E$
\item Compute the projected samples as $P=X\cdot E$
\item You can compute the reconstruction as $\tilde{X} = P\cdot E^T$
\end{itemize}
