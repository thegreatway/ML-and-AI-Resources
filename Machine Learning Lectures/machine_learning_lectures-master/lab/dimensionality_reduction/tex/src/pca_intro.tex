\begin{frame}{PCA}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear dimensionality reduction model
\begin{itemize}
\item Subspace projection is linear
\item Reconstruction is linear
\end{itemize}
\item Projects data in a new space subject to:
\begin{itemize}
\item the direction exhibiting highest variance in feature space is projected on the first axis, the one exhibiting the second highest variance on the second axis, and so on.
\item axis of the new space are orthogonal (covariance is zero).
\end{itemize}
