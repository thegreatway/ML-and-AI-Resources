To classify a test image:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project the image in the reduced spaces built in the training phase
\item Perform \textbf{nearest neighbor classification}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Roughly speaking, \underline{choose the class of the nearest training example} (in the reduced space)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
