\section{Synthetic Sequence Dataset}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Synthetic Sequence Dataset}
For this practice I prepared a \textbf{synthetic dataset} consisting in $\bm{2^{20}}$ \textbf{binary sequences}.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
For each input sequence, the target is the number of ones in the sequence.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
From an implementation standpoint, the target is encoded as one-hot vector. Thus, examples $(x, y)$ from the dataset looks like the following:
\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
input & target\\
00110011111000111101 & 000000000000100000000\\
01000010100001010000 & 000001000000000000000\\
11101110010111011110 & 000000000000001000000
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Synthetic Sequence Dataset}
The dataset can be found in \texttt{synthetic\_dataset.py}.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Loading the data is as simple as:
\begin{verbatim}
from synthetic_dataset import SyntheticSequenceDataset
synthetic_dataset   = SyntheticSequenceDataset()
\end{verbatim}
Synthetic data are automatically either generated or loaded from cache (if existent) the first time that dataset property \texttt{data} is accessed.

\section{Learning to Count}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Goal}
Our task is to \textbf{count the number of ones in the binary sequences}.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
The goal of this practice is to implement and train a \textbf{LSTM} \cite{hochreiter1997long} network to do so.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Useful Functions}
To this purpose, you may find useful the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell}
\item \texttt{tf.nn.dynamic\_rnn}
\item \texttt{tf.transpose}
\item \texttt{tf.gather}
\item \texttt{tf.layers.dense}
\end{itemize}
Please refer to the docs to know the exact API.
