\section{MNIST}

\begin{frame}{MNIST Dataset}
\textbf{MNIST\cite{lecun1998mnist} is a database of handwritten digits} consisting of 60K training images and 10K testing images. All digits have been centered in 28x28 grayscale images.

\begin{tabular}{c}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/tf/mnist.png}
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{MNIST Dataset}
Due to its simplicity (in 2017!) the MNIST dataset is often considered to be the "Hello World!" in the Machine Learning framework.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
In \texttt{lab\_utils.py} I already implemented a function \texttt{get\_mnist\_data} that handles the download and loading of the dataset.\\
\begin{verbatim}
    # Load MNIST data
    mnist = get_mnist_data('/tmp/mnist', verbose=True)
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\section{Goal}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Goal}
The \textbf{goal} of this practice is to \textbf{implement a fully-connected neural network to perform 10-class classification} on the MNIST dataset.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Outline}
Some advices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take your time to explore the dataset
\item Start small and make the whole training pipeline working
\item First implement a single hidden layer neural network
\item Implement a bigger network: how does this affects performance?
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
