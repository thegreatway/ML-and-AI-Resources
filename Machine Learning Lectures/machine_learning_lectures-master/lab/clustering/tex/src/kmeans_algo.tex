The problem is NP-hard. A simple heuristic algorithm can be employed to converge to a \emph{local} minimum:
\begin{itemize}
\item Initialize $k$ centers randomly
\item Repeat until convergence:
\begin{itemize}
\item assign each example to the closest center (i.e. lower euclidean distance)
\item re-estimate centers as the mean of their clusters
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Try to implement it from scratch!
