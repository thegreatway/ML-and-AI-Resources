\section{Linear Regression}

\begin{frame}{Goal}
TensorFlow fully unleashes its power when used for deep learning applications. However, this framework can be used to implement any gradient-based learning pipeline.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
The goal of this first practice session is implementing a simple \textbf{linear regression} model in TensorFlow\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Data}
For this practice we'll use a small dataset which puts in relation the weight of brain and body for a number of mammal species.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
The whole dataset can be found here:\\
\url{http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/x01.txt}\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
The goal is to fit a simple linear regression model (\textit{i.e.} a line) to this data.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Starter Pack}
I already downloaded the data for you. You'll find it in \texttt{data/brain\_body\_weight.txt}.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Also, a function to load the data into python script is available in \texttt{lab\_utils.py}.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Outline}
Here's the outline of what you're expected to do:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load data using \texttt{lab\_utils/get\_brain\_body\_data}
\item Define appropriate placeholders using \texttt{tf.placeholder}
\item Define weight and bias variables using \texttt{tf.Variable}
\item Define 1-d linear regression model $y_{pred} = x w + b$
\item Define an appropriate objective function, e.g. $(y_{pred} - y_{true})^2$
\item Create an Optimizer (e.g. \texttt{tf.train.AdamOptimizer})
\item Define a train iteration as one step of loss minimization
\item Loop train iteration until convergence
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile, allowframebreaks]{Template}
\begin{verbatim}
    # Read data
    body_weight, brain_weight = # todo
    n_samples = len(body_weight)

    # Define placeholders (1-d)
    x, y = # todo
	
    # Define variables
    w, b = # todo

    # Linear regression model
    y_pred = # todo

    # Define objective function
    loss = # todo

    # Define optimizer
    optimizer = # todo

    # Define one training iteration
    train_step = # todo
    
    with tf.Session() as sess:

        # Initialize all variables
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

        for i in range(n_epochs):
            total_loss = 0
            for bo_w, br_w in zip(body_weight, brain_weight):
                _, l = sess.run([train_step, loss],
                                feed_dict={x: bo_w, y: br_w})
                total_loss += l
            print('Epoch {0}: {1}'.format(i, total_loss / n_samples))\end{verbatim}
