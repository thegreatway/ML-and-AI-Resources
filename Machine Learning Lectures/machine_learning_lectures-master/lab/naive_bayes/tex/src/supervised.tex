\begin{frame}{Supervised learning setting}
We are given a training set $\{X_i, Y_i\}_{i=1}^n$, with $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $Y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ for each $i=1,\ldots,n$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $n$ is the number of training images;
\item each image $X_i = \{x_i^{(1)}, \ldots , x_i^{(m)}\}$ is a vector of $m$ pixels;
\item each label $Y_i$ is just a number among $\{1, \ldots, d\}$.
\end{itemize}
