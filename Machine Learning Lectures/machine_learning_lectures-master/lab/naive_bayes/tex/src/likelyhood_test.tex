\begin{frame}{Likelyhood $P(X/Y)$}
During testing, the likelyhood of an image under a class is built by taking the class model (the one built before, during training) and:
\begin{itemize}
\item for each active pixel, account for the probability of being active given class;
\item for each zero pixel, account for one minus the probability of being active given class;
\end{itemize}
