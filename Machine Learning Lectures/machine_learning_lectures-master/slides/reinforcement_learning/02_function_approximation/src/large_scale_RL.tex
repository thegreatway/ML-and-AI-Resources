\begin{frame}{Large scale reinforcement learning}
Reinforcement learning can be used to solve large problems, e.g.
\begin{itemize}
\item Backgammon: $10^{20}$ states
\item Computer Go: $10^{170}$ states
\item Helicopter: continuous state space
\end{itemize}

How can we scale up the model-free methods for prediction and control from the last lecture?}
