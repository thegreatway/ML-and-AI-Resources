\begin{frame}{RL Characteristics}
What makes reinforcement learning different from other machine learning paradigms?
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no supervisor, only a \emph{reward} signal.
\item Feedback is delayed, not instantaneous
\item Time really matters (sequential, non i.i.d. data)
\item Agent is \emph{active}: its actions affect the environment he lives in.
\end{itemize}
